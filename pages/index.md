# Crafter Hustle
**Crafter Hustle** is a reference application as well as a reference model for event sourcing. This is not a commercial application, it's a demonstration. The event model on this documentation site is the result of a  number of iterations of _event storming_ and identifying _bounded contexts_. This iterative process is described elsewhere.

## The Application
**Crafter Hustle** is an application designed to help crafters manage their side hustle. It supports the management of physical inventory, consignment of inventory to remote locations, customer management, sale of inventory at craft shows, anonymous sales resulting in inventory changes, and more.

One of the things that subject matter experts (actual crafters, unlike me) wanted was the ability to see year-over-year which shows and consignments were turning a profit and which were not. This helps crafters plan what they make, how much they make, and where and how frequently they sell.

This application is designed to be a complete and fully functioning app based on this event model. All too often the "hello world" applications are too simple and so they fail to illustrate some of the subtleties involved in both design and implementation.

To use the application, go to [crafterhustle.com](https://crafterhustle.com).
